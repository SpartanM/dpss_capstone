# Hate Crimes in the United States
This is Yaoli Ma's Capstone Project on Hate Crimes in the United States for Data and Policy Summer Scholar (DPSS) Program 2019 at Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago. 

In this Capstone Project, I examine the potential causes/correlates of hate crimes in the United States. The goal is to replicate [this analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/higher-rates-of-hate-crimes-are-tied-to-income-inequality/) from FiveThirtyEight using updated hate crime data and additional regressors.
